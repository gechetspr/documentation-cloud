This document describes how to set up an SSL certificate (SSL) for a production environment. 

By default, all the domain names (domains) are provided with generic SSLs, which are managed automatically. For the production environment, you can set up a custom SSL certificate. 

:::(Info) (Third-party DNS zone provider)
If the DNS zone of a domain name is hosted with a third-party provider, it is impossible to use the generic SSLs and manage custom SSLs in Spryker Cloud Commerce OS.
:::
:::(Warning) (Pre-installed SSLs)
If you provided custom SSLs for the initial setup, they are already installed and you can skip this step.

## Setting up a custom SSL certificate

To set up a custom SSL:

1. Register an SSL.
2. Provide the following details via [support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/):
    * Domain name
    * Certificate body
    * Certificate private key
    * Optional: Certificate chain
    :::(Warning) (Format)
    The values should be [PEM-encoded](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate-format.html).
    :::
    
We set up the SSL shortly after you have provided it.
