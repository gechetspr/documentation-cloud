Currently, Xdebug is not supported, but you can enable extended logs in the deploy file to debug an application. Extended logs provide extra information about application state and behavior. 

To enable extended logs:

1. Edit `deploy.*.yml` of the desired environment:

```yaml
docker:
    debug:
        enabled: true
```

2. Depending on the `environment` value of `deploy.*.yml`, edit the respective `config_default.php`:

```php
$config[LogConstants::LOG_LEVEL] = getenv('SPRYKER_DEBUG_ENABLED') ? Logger::INFO : Logger::DEBUG;
```

3. Commit the changes and deploy the application in the desired environment:
    * [Deploy in the production environment](https://cloud.spryker.com/docs/deploying-in-a-production-environment)
    * [Deploy in the staging environment](https://cloud.spryker.com/docs/deploying-in-a-staging-environment)

Extended logs are enabled and you can check them in the AWS Management Console. See [Working with logs](https://cloud.spryker.com/docs/working-with-logs) for more details.
