This document describes how to connect a code repository to Spryker Cloud Commerce OS. 

:::(Info) (Initial setup)
If you specified a code repository in the Onboarding Questionnaire, we connected it to your Staging environment during the initial setup. To connect a code repository to another environment, follow this document.  
:::

Spryker Cloud Commerce OS supports the following version control systems:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)


## Connect a GitHub code repository
To connect a GitHub code repository:

1. Configure a GitHub code repository.
2. Provide the following details via [support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/): 

* **URL**
* **Branch**
* **Access token**


We connect the code repository shortly after you provide the details.

 


## Connect a Bitbucket code repository

Currently, only GitHub is integrated into AWS CodeBuild. To use a Bitbucket code repository, configure [AWS CodeStar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/welcome.html) by following the steps below. 


### Prerequisites

Ensure that your BitBucket account has *Admin* permissions in the code repository. 

AWS CodeStar integrates via OAuth 2.0 and requires the following permissions:

* Read your account information.

* Read your repositories and their pull requests.

* Administer your repositories.

* Read and modify your repositories.


### Retrieve a connection ARN

To get an [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of a connection, create a *CodeBuild Connection*:

1. In the AWS Management Platform, go to **Services** > **CodeBuild** > **Settings** > **[Connections](http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections)**.
2. Select **Create connection**.
3. In the *Create a connection* pane, select **BitBucket**.
4. Enter **Connection name**.

![create a connection](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/create-a-connection.png){height="" width=""}


5. Select **Connect to Bitbucket**.

6. Select **Grant access**.

![grant access highlighted](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/grant-access-highlighted.png){height="" width=""}

7. Select **Install a new app**.

8. Select **Grant access**.

![grant access](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/grant-accees.png){height="" width=""} 

9. In the *Connect to Bitbucket* pane, select **Connect**.

![connect repository](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/connect-repository.png){height="" width=""}

The page refreshes with all the fields cleared. 

10. Select **Connections**.

In the *Connections* pane, you can see the created connection and its ARN.

![connections](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/connections.png){height="" width=""}

11. Provide the connection ARN via [support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/).

We connect the repository shortly after you provide the details.

## Connect a GitLab code repository

Currently, [CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html) doesnâ€™t have a native integration of GitLab. To make it work, you can configure a [CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html) repository as a mirror of a GitLab repository. 

:::(Warning) (Pushing changes)
To avoid synchronization issues, do not push any changes to the CodeCommit repository. 
:::

### Prerequisites
Prepare for configuration:

1. Ensure that your GitLab account has *Admin* permissions in the code repository.
2. Request the following details via [support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/):
    * CodeCommit repository URL 
    * Username and password for HTTPS authorization in CodeCommit repository


### GitLab mirroring

To configure GitLab mirroring:

1. In the GitLab account, go to the code repository.
2. Select **Settings** > **Repository**.
3. Select **Expand** next to *Mirroring repositories*.

![GitLab navigation](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/gitlab-navigation.png){height="" width=""}

4. In **Git repository URL**, enter the CodeCommit repository URL provided by support. 
5. For **Mirror direction**, select **Push**.
6. For **Authentication method**, select **Password**.
7. Enter a **Password**.
8. Select **Mirror repository**.

![CodeCommit repository details](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloud-docs/Spryker+Cloud/Connecting+code+repository/codecommit-repository-details.png){height="" width=""}

Allow the synchronization several minutes to complete and you should see the record of your mirrored repository.
