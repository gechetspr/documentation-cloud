Spryker Docker SDK is a tool used to set up docker environments for Spryker projects.

This is an optional tool, but we highly recommend installing it to make your local environment similar to the one in Spryker Cloud Commerce OS. 


## Connect Docker SDK
To connect Docker SDK to your project, follow the instructions in [Integrating the Docker SDK into existing projects](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/integrating-the-docker-sdk-into-existing-projects).

:::(Error) (Deploy file)
At the [Set up a Deploy file](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/integrating-the-docker-sdk-into-existing-projects#set-up-a-deploy-file) step, instead of setting up a new deploy file, use the one provided to you after the onboarding.
